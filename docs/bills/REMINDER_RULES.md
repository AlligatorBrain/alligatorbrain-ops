# Bill Reminder Rules (v0.1)

For every bill in docs/bills/BILLS.md and docs/ops/ASHLEY_BILLS.md:

## T-7 days (Heads-up)
- Confirm upcoming due date
- Confirm expected amount (fixed/estimate/variable)
- Confirm autopay ON/OFF

## T-2 days (Action check)
- Confirm funds available
- If manual pay: schedule payment now
- If autopay: confirm payment method valid

## T day (Proof)
- Mark paid
- Save receipt location (not the receipt itself)
- Note any issue / late fee / vendor change
